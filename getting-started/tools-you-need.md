# Tools You Need

Pre-requisite: you need to know how to install and play a mod already.

## Essential Tools

### 1. XML Editor

You can start modding any special tools by simply modifying existing mods with Notepad. But I strongly recommend to use an editor with built-in XML support.

Best use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it comes with a [plugin for Anno Modding](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JakobHarder.anno-modding-tools).
Open it, go to `Extensions` (Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for `Anno Modding Tools` to install the plugin.

### 2. RDAExplorer

The [RDAExplorer](https://github.com/lysannschlegel/RDAExplorer) is a tool to extract files from the game.
You need this to understand what's in the game and reuse graphics.

If you have the space, I recommend to extract all `.rda`s into one folder beginning from 0 to the highest number.

Some `.rda`s have the same file again (e.g. `assets.xml`), the file from the highest numbered `.rda` is the only one the game will use.

### 3. Assets Search

If you want to do more than changing some values of existing mods, you need to research or refer to existing definitions called `Assets` of the game.

You can:
- use [Schwubbe's online Asset Search](https://schwubbe.de/modding_blog.php#beitrag15) or,
- use [Anno 1800 Mod Tools Online](https://a1800.net/) for more advanced asset/template browsing or,
- extract `assets.xml` with the RDAExplorer and use Visual Studio Code search (Ctrl+Shift+F)
