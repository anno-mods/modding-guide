# Tutorial 2 - Making a new specialist

## Time for our second mod, a new specialist

With Feras, we have changed an existing item, but that is not the best practice. Changing existing items increases potential problems. With every official update Ubisoft rolls out they can potentially change logic and items in the game. When we modify items they also use, this can increase the amount of conflicts. A better way is to create our own items.

When modding it is up to you what kind of modder you want to be. Do you want to make things that make your game experience easier and “cheat” or do you want to keep the balance and enrich the experience. Personally I do not like the mods that give a feeling of cheating. I always go for balance and love the fact we can add stuff to the game to enrich the experience.

For our second mod we are going to make a new specialist. Our imagination is limitless! Maybe you always thought about a specialist missing from the game. Now is the time we are going to realise this! We are going to create an specialist for the gold mines in the New World. This mine has a high production time and with an item we could boost this production without touching the mine itself and giving the player the opportunity to boost the production with an trade union item and keep the game balanced.
