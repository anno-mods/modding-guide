# How to Contribute to the Anno 117 Modding Guide

To contribute to the modding guide you should first create your own fork that you can work on. There you can add or edit anything you want. once you are happy with your work you can open a pull request for us to merge your contributions into this repository. We will then review your request and merge your contribution. Also, don't worry too much about the review, this is neither school nor a job interview, we'll just check if what you wrote is accurate and follows these guidelines.

## Tutorials/Guides

If you want to contribute your own tutorial/guide you should follow these guidelines:
- Try not to make duplicate tutorials/guides. If you think a tutorial/guide is incomplete or faulty, you can always raise an issue or mark from where to branch from another tutorial/guide. If there is an empty file for your tutorial/guide, just use that.
- Choose an appropriate subfolder for your tutorial. If the topic of your tutorial is not a good fit for any of the existing topics, make a new folder that has the same file structure and a similar README.md like the other topics.
- Write your tutorial/guide in markdown. Name your tutorial/guide in a descriptive manner with the prefix `tut-`.
- Save your images and other sources (except for code snippets) in the `_source` folder of your topic. If a source is already in that folder you can use it as well. Name your sources in a descriptive manner.

## Documentation

If you want to contribute to the documentation of a topic or a new topic you should follow these guidelines:
- Keep it consistent to already existing documentation. This makes it easier for everyone to read.
- Keep the documentation to one file, unless you have a **really** good reason not to. in that case, make a new file with the prefix `doc-` and a descriptive name.
- Only expand or rephrase documentation. If you think something should shortened or removed or contains faulty information, please raise an issue.
- If your contribution requires images or other sources, handle it the same way resources are handled for tutorials/guides.

## Code Snippets and Examples

If you want to contribute code snippets or other examples you should follow these guidelines:
- Please only contribute readable code. This repository is here so that others can learn from you and that isn't possible if no one can understand what you did.
- Try to make thematic files. It is better if you have two files if your snippets are unrelated to each other excpet for the fact that you made them.
- Choose descriptive file names so that people can figure out what your file contains. This is especially true for XML snippets where Anno requires the file to be called `assets.xml`.
